# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis
This is my repository for Prodigy Infotech Internship! These documents are for the task 2 of my internship program on data analysis, comparison and categorical representation.

# Task Obejctive:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

# Insights:
Performing data cleaning and EDA involves understanding the structure and quality of data, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data types are appropriate. It also includes visualizing relationships between variables to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that inform subsequent analytical decisions and model building.
